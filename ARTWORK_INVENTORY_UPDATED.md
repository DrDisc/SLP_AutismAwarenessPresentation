## 🎨 Design Tips

- **Half width:** 3-3.5 inches (50% page width)
- **Small accent:** 2-3 inches (25-30% page width)

### Placement Strategy
- Place between text blocks for visual breaks
- Use as section headers (image + title overlay)
- Create visual flow with consistent spacing
- Pair similar-sized images to create balance

### Text Wrapping
- Avoid text wrapping around images (cleaner look)
- Place images between paragraphs
- Add 0.2" spacing above/below images
- Left/right align for varied layout
