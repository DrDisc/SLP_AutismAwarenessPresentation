## SLIDE 1: TITLE (30 seconds)
**"Supporting Your Child's Communication Journey: The Role of Speech-Language Pathologists"**

Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is Vanessa Lapuz, and I'm a Speech-Language Pathologist. Thank you for being here today. I know that receiving an autism diagnosis for your child can feel overwhelming, and you probably have many questions about what comes next and how to best support your child. Today, I want to share with you how Speech-Language Pathologists can be a vital part of your child's team, and why starting early can make such a significant difference.

## SLIDE 2: WHAT IS A SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST? (1 minute)

**What is an SLP?**

You might be wondering, "What exactly is a Speech-Language Pathologist?" Let me explain:

- We are **healthcare professionals** who specialize in communication and feeding/swallowing
- We help children and adults with speaking, understanding language, and social communication
- We're often called "speech therapists," though our work goes far beyond just speech sounds

**Education Required in Ontario:**
To become an SLP in Ontario, we must complete:
- A 4-year **undergraduate degree** (often in linguistics, psychology, or related fields)
- A 2-3 year **Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology** with extensive clinical training
- **Registration with CASLPO** (College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario)
- Ongoing continuing education throughout our careers

This means your SLP has at least 6-7 years of university education and supervised clinical experience specifically focused on helping people communicate effectively.

## SLIDE 3: HOW SLPs HELP CHILDREN WITH AUTISM (1.5 minutes)

**The SLP's Role with Autism**

Children with autism often experience challenges in areas that are our specialty:

**1. Social Communication**
- Learning to interact with others
- Understanding facial expressions and body language
- Taking turns in conversations
- Making friends and maintaining relationships

**2. Spoken Language**
- Some children may be non-speaking or minimally verbal
- Others may have extensive vocabulary but struggle with conversation
- We help at whatever level your child is at right now

**3. Non-Verbal Communication**
- Gestures, pointing, and eye contact
- Using pictures or communication devices
- Any way your child wants to communicate is valid

**4. Understanding Language**
- Following directions
- Understanding questions
- Processing information at school or home

**What makes SLPs unique:** We don't just focus on getting children to talk. We focus on helping them **connect with others** in whatever way works best for them—whether that's through words, pictures, sign language, or technology.

## SLIDE 4: THE POWER OF EARLY INTERVENTION (1.5 minutes)

**Why Early Matters: The Research**

This is where I want to emphasize something really important: **Early intervention can change your child's developmental trajectory.**

**What the research shows:**
- The first 3 years of life are when a child's brain is most flexible and responsive to learning
- Children who receive early intervention services show better outcomes in:
  - Communication skills
  - Social interaction
  - School readiness
  - Independence and daily living skills
  - Reduced challenging behaviors

**You don't need to wait:**
- You can start services even BEFORE a formal diagnosis
- If you have concerns about your child's communication, that's enough to seek help
- In Ontario, many services are available for young children

**Early signs to watch for** (usually noticed between 12-24 months):
- Not responding to their name
- Limited babbling or speech sounds
- Not pointing to show you things
- Loss of previously acquired skills
- Limited eye contact or social engagement

**Important:** These are just general guidelines. Every child develops differently, and having one or two of these signs doesn't mean your child has autism. But if you're concerned, talk to your doctor or an SLP.

**The hopeful message:** Your child's brain is amazingly adaptable, especially when young. The support you provide now, with the help of professionals like SLPs, can help your child develop skills they'll use throughout their life.

## SLIDE 5: WHAT SLP SERVICES LOOK LIKE (1 minute)

**What to Expect from SLP Services**

I want you to understand what working with an SLP actually looks like:

**Assessment:**
- We start by getting to know your child's unique strengths and needs
- Assessments are often play-based and family-centered
- You are the expert on your child—we work together

**Treatment Approaches:**
- **Play-based therapy** - Learning through natural, fun activities
- **Family coaching** - Teaching you strategies to use at home
- **AAC (Augmentative & Alternative Communication)** - Technology or picture systems if helpful
- **Social skills groups** - Practice with other children
- **Natural environment teaching** - Skills practiced in real-life settings

**Where services happen:**
- Clinics or private practice offices
- Your home
- Schools and daycares
- Community settings

**Family involvement is key:**
- You'll learn strategies to support communication all day, not just during therapy
- We'll celebrate every milestone, no matter how small
- Communication happens everywhere—we'll help you make the most of daily routines

## SLIDE 6: REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS & HOPE (45 seconds)

**What You Can Expect**

I want to be honest and hopeful with you:

**Every child is unique:**
- Progress looks different for every child
- We celebrate ALL forms of communication
- Some children will develop spoken language; others may use other communication methods
- Both paths are valid and valuable

**What we focus on:**
- Helping your child express their wants, needs, and ideas
- Reducing frustration
- Building connections with family and friends
- Increasing independence and participation in life

**The research is clear:** Early intervention with an SLP, combined with your support at home, gives your child the best opportunity to develop their communication potential.

## CLOSING (30 seconds)

**You're Not Alone**

I want to leave you with this: You are your child's best advocate and most important teacher. An autism diagnosis doesn't define your child's potential—it simply helps us understand how to best support them.

As an SLP, I see remarkable progress every day when families and therapists work together. Your child has unique gifts and abilities, and my role is to help them share those with the world.

Thank you for your time today. I'm here at my booth and would love to speak with each of you individually. Please don't hesitate to come by with your questions, concerns, or just to talk.

**Remember: Early intervention + Family support + Professional guidance = Hope and progress**

Thank you.
