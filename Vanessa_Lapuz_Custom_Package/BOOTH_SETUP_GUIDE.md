## BOOTH ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES

### Opening Lines
When parents approach your booth:

1. **Welcoming:** "Hi! Thanks for stopping by. Did you get a chance to attend the presentation?"

2. **Assessment:** "What brings you to the event today? Is this your first time learning about autism services?"

3. **Offer value:** "I have some great resources here. Can I help you find something specific, or would you like to just browse?"

4. **Low pressure:** "Feel free to take any handouts. I'm here if you have questions."

### Conversation Starters
- "Tell me about your child."
- "What are your biggest concerns right now?"
- "Have you worked with an SLP before?"
- "What questions came up for you during the presentation?"

### Active Listening
- Maintain eye contact
- Nod and acknowledge emotions
- Reflect back: "It sounds like you're feeling..."
- Validate: "That's a very common concern."
- Avoid jargon—speak in plain language
