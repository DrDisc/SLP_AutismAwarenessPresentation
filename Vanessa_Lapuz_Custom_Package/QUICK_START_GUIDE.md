## ❓ FAQs

### "I've never done a presentation before. Is this too much?"
No! The script is written out word-for-word. With practice, even first-timers can deliver confidently. Start practicing early.

### "Can I shorten the presentation?"
Yes. Priority slides: 1 (intro), 4 (early intervention), 5 (what services look like), 7 (next steps). This can be done in 4 minutes.

### "What if I don't have all the booth materials?"
Start with the essentials: table, handouts, business cards, sign-in sheet. Everything else is nice-to-have.

### "Do I need to memorize the script?"
No. Use it as a detailed guide. Practice until you're comfortable speaking naturally about each point. Having notes is fine!

### "What if someone asks a question I can't answer?"
Perfect response: "That's a great question. Let me get your contact info and I'll research that and get back to you." Then follow up!

### "How many people should I expect?"
Varies widely by event. Plan for 20-50 booth visitors and 5-15 meaningful consultations. Track numbers to improve future planning.
