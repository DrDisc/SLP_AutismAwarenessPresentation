# 10 Ways to Encourage Communication at Home
## Simple Strategies for Parents of Children with Autism

---

## You Are Your Child's First and Best Teacher!

Communication happens all day, every day—not just during therapy sessions. These strategies will help you create more opportunities for your child to communicate throughout daily routines.

---

## 1. Get Down to Their Level 👁️

**What:** Position yourself at your child's eye level during interactions.

**Why:** It's easier for your child to see your face, read your expressions, and feel less intimidated.

**How:**
- Sit on the floor during play
- Kneel down when talking
- Bring activities to a low table or coffee table

**Example:** Instead of calling from across the room, go to your child, sit beside them, and engage face-to-face.

---

## 2. Follow Your Child's Lead 🎯

**What:** Let your child choose the activity and follow their interests.

**Why:** Children communicate more when they're interested and engaged.

**How:**
- Observe what your child is drawn to
- Join them in their play without taking over
- Comment on what they're doing
- Add language to their interests

**Example:** If your child is lining up cars, sit down and join them. Say, "Red car! Blue car! Car goes beep beep!" Don't force them to play "the right way."

---

## 3. Create Communication Opportunities 🤔

**What:** Set up situations where your child needs to communicate.

**Why:** Reduces frustration and motivates communication when there's a reason to talk.

**How:**
- Put favorite items in clear containers they can't open
- Place toys on high shelves (in sight but out of reach)
- Give small portions (to encourage asking for more)
- "Forget" essential items (fork at snack time, battery in toy)
- Pause and wait expectantly

**Example:** At snack time, hand your child a sealed bag of crackers. Wait. They may hand it back, reach toward you, make a sound, or even attempt a word. Respond immediately: "Oh! You want help opening it!"

---

## 4. Use the Power of Pause ⏸️

**What:** After you speak or model language, wait silently for 5-10 seconds.

**Why:** Gives your child time to process and respond. Many children need extra time.

**How:**
- Count to 10 in your head
- Look expectantly at your child
- Resist the urge to fill the silence
- Don't repeat immediately

**Example:** 
You: "What do you want? Juice or milk?" 
[PAUSE... count to 10]
If no response, you can offer choices again or help them.

---

## 5. Narrate Your World 🗣️

**What:** Talk about what you're doing during daily routines.

**Why:** Provides constant language models and connects words to actions.

**How:**
- Describe what you see: "I see a big truck!"
- Describe what you're doing: "Mommy is washing the dishes."
- Describe what your child is doing: "You're stacking blocks!"
- Keep it simple—1-2 words above your child's level

**Example During Bath Time:**
"Water! Warm water. Splish splash! Wash your tummy. Rub rub rub. Bubbles! Pop the bubbles!"

---

## 6. Make Comments, Not Questions ❓➡️💬

**What:** Use more comments and fewer questions during interactions.

**Why:** Questions can feel like tests and create pressure. Comments model language without demanding responses.

**Ratio to Aim For:** 80% comments, 20% questions

**How:**
Instead of: "What's that?" → Say: "That's a dog!"  
Instead of: "What color is it?" → Say: "A red ball!"  
Instead of: "Where is daddy?" → Say: "Daddy's at work!"

**Example During Play:**
❌ "What does the cow say?" "Where does the cow live?" "What color is the cow?"  
✅ "Cow! Big cow. Moo! The cow says moo. Brown cow."

---

## 7. Expand and Extend Language 📈

**What:** Take what your child says and add one or two words to it.

**Why:** Models the next step in language development without being overwhelming.

**How:**
- If your child says one word, you say two words
- If your child says two words, you say three or four words
- Don't correct—just model the right way

**Examples:**
- Child: "Ball!" → You: "Big ball!" or "Roll ball!"
- Child: "More!" → You: "More crackers!" or "Want more!"
- Child: "Car go" → You: "Car goes fast!" or "Red car goes!"
- Child: "I want dat" → You: "You want the truck!"

---

## 8. Use Visual Supports 📸

**What:** Pictures, photos, objects, or gestures to support understanding.

**Why:** Many children with autism are visual learners. Pictures make abstract language concrete.

**How:**
- **First-Then boards:** "First snack, then playground"
- **Visual schedules:** Pictures showing the day's activities
- **Choice boards:** Photos of 2-3 options
- **Communication books:** Pictures of favorite things, people, places
- **Gestures:** Point, show, sign

**Example:** Before transitions: Show two pictures: "First cleanup, THEN iPad."

---

## 9. Celebrate ALL Communication 🎉

**What:** Respond to every communication attempt, whether it's words, sounds, gestures, or eye contact.

**Why:** Builds confidence and encourages more communication attempts.

**How:**
- Acknowledge sounds: "You said something!"
- Respond to gestures: "You're pointing! You want the book!"
- Notice eye contact: "You looked at me! You're ready!"
- Praise attempts: "Good trying to say banana!"
- Give them what they're asking for (whenever possible)

**Example:**
Child reaches toward shelf and makes a sound  
You: "Oh! You want something! What do you see? The ball! Here's the ball!"
(Immediately give them access—this teaches that communication works!)

---

## 10. Create Routines and Rituals 🔄

**What:** Predictable activities that happen the same way each time.

**Why:** Routines help children know what to expect and what language to anticipate. Familiarity reduces anxiety.

**How:**
- Use the same words/songs for daily activities
- Bath time routine, mealtime routine, bedtime routine
- Pause at predictable moments for your child to "fill in the blank"
- Make routines fun and engaging

**Example - Bedtime Routine:**
1. Bath time: "Splish splash, time for bath!"
2. Pajamas: "Arms up! Legs in!"
3. Story: Same books with predictable text
4. Song: Same goodnight song every night
5. Pause before the last word: "Goodnight, sweet..." [wait for "baby" or approximation]
